			//   real layout (jQuery :visible, innerText). jsdom has no layout,
			//   so unit assertions there would pin the wrong semantics. They
			//   are exercised in real Chrome by the Playwright suite.
			// - content-entries/**: bundle shims, no logic.
			// - popup/options/player/languages/advanced-options: jQuery DOM
			//   pages, covered by Playwright plus axe scans.
			// - events.js: service worker orchestration (injection, menus,
			//   commands), covered by the Playwright extension harness.
